    "When choosing a Python interpreter, one looming question is always present: “Should I choose Python 2 or Python 3”? \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic gist of the state of things is as follows:\n",
    "1. Most production applications today use Python 2.7.\n",
    "2. Python 3 is ready for the production deployment of applications today.\n",
    "3. Python 2.7 will only receive necessary security updates until 2020.\n",
    "4. The brand name “Python” encapsulates both Python 3 and Python 2."

    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Python 3 for new Python applications.\n",
    "2. Learn both. They are both “Python”.\n",
    "3. Software that is already built often depends on Python 2.7.\n",
    "4. If you are writing a new open source Python library, it’s best to write it for both Python 2 and 3 simultaneously. Only supporting Python 3 for a new library you want to be widely adopted is a political statement and will alienate many of your users. This is not a problem — slowly, over the next three years, this will become less the case."
