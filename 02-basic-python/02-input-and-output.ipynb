    "There are two ways to format your output:\n",

    "    - using string slicing and concatenation operations you can create any layout you can imagine.\n",
    "    - The string type has some methods that perform useful operations for padding strings to a given column width; these will be discussed shortly. \n",
    "- The second way is to use the `str.format()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `string` module contains a `Template` class which offers yet another way to substitute values into strings.\n",

    "One question remains, of course: how do you convert values to strings? Luckily, Python has ways to convert any value to a string: \n",
    "- pass it to the repr() or str() functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The str() function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while repr() is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a SyntaxError if there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which donâ€™t have a particular representation for human consumption, str() will return the same value as repr(). Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation using either function. Strings, in particular, have two distinct representations.\n",
