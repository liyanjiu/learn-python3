    "### Naming restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a layer of a project can handle interfacing with user actions, while another would handle low-level manipulation of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most natural way to separate these into two layers:\n",
    "1. all interfacing functionality in one file\n",
    "2. all low-level operations in another file. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the interface file needs to `import` the low-level file. This is done with the import and from ... import statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you use import statements you use modules. These can be either:\n",
    "- Built-in modules such as os and sys. \n",
    "- Third-party modules you have installed in your environment.\n",
    "- Or your project’s internal modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep in line with the style guide: \n",
    "1. Keep module names **short, lowercase, and there is no need to separate words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Don’t namespace with underscores, use submodules instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Be sure to avoid using special symbols like the dot (.) or question mark (?)**. (In the case of my.spam.py Python expects to find a spam.py file in a folder named my which is not the case.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using other characters (spaces or hyphens) in module names will prevent importing (- is the subtract operator)**.\n",

    "### Import mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from some naming restrictions, nothing special is required for a Python file to be a module, but you need to understand the import mechanism in order to use this concept properly and avoid some issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 : Search the module in path\n",
    "Concretely, the import modu statement will look for the proper file, which is modu.py in: \n",
    "1. First, the same directory as the caller if it exists. \n",
    "2. If it is not found, the Python interpreter will search for modu.py in the “path” recursively and raise an ImportError exception if it is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2 : Execute the module in an  isolated scope\n",
    "Once modu.py is found, the Python interpreter will execute the module in an isolated scope. Any top-level statement in modu.py will be executed, including other imports if any. Function and class definitions are stored in the module’s dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3 : Available to the caller in module's namespace\n",
    "Then, the module’s variables, functions, and classes will be available to the caller through the module’s namespace, a central concept in programming that is particularly helpful and powerful in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "```\n",
    "In many languages, an include file directive is used by the preprocessor to take all code found in the file and ‘copy’ it into the caller’s code. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is different in Python: the included code is isolated in a module namespace, which means that you generally don’t have to worry that the included code could have unwanted effects, e.g. override an existing function with the same name.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### from ... import ... statement\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to simulate the more standard behavior by using a special syntax of the import statement: `rom modu import *`. This is generally considered bad practice. Using import * makes code harder to read and makes dependencies less compartmentalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `from modu import func` is a way to pinpoint the function you want to import and put it in the global namespace. While much less harmful than import * because it shows explicitly what is imported in the global namespace, its only advantage over a simpler import modu is that it will save a little typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Very Bad\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "from modu import *\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "x = sqrt(4)  # Is sqrt part of modu? A builtin? Defined above?\n",

    "\n",
    "Python has two kinds of built-in or user-defined types.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Immutable types provide no method for changing their content. For instance, the variable x set to the integer 6 has no “increment” method. If you want to compute x + 1, you have to create another integer and give it a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using properly mutable types for things that are mutable in nature and immutable types for things that are fixed in nature helps to clarify the intent of the code.For example, the immutable equivalent of a list is the tuple, created with (1, 2). This tuple is a pair that cannot be changed in-place, and can be used as a key for a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "One peculiarity of Python that can surprise beginners is that **strings are immutable**. This means that when constructing a string from its parts, it is much more efficient to accumulate the parts in a list, which is mutable, and then glue (‘join’) the parts together when the full string is needed. One thing to notice, however, is that list comprehensions are better and faster than constructing a list in a loop with calls to append().\n",
    "\n",
    "One other option is using the map function, which can ‘map’ a function (‘str’) to an iterable (‘range(20)’). This results in a map object, which you can then (‘join’) together just like the other examples. The map function can be even faster than a list comprehension in some cases."
